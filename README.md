# fileTransfer
to use this "APP" you need to have a computer with a web server installed with support for php and it should be configured to allow uploads of as large as the size of files you wish to transfer, also in case you will be transfering multiple files then its a good idea to increase the number of simulteneous post request 

most of the configurations will involve editing the php.ini file so in the test run its most likely to crash and the solve wold be to edit the right part of php.ini 


to use it simply clone it to the folder your webserver serves off of and you can access it usins http://{serverIpAddress}/fileTransfer

hope this is useful to you in some way
